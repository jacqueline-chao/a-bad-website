    <title>What I Like About Each Color</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Violet:</h1>
    <p>Violet is a deep and beautiful color! It is also the color of royalty.</p>
    <h1>Blue:</h1>
    <p>Blue can come in so many different shades, and all of them are beautiful! Both the sky and the sea are blue.</p>
    <h1>Green:</h1>
    <p>Green is a very calming color. When people think of nature, they typically think of the color green as well. It can be a deep forest green or a funky neon green!</p>
    <h1>Yellow:</h1>
    <p>Yellow reminds me of sunshine. If metallic and of a deeper shade, it could be described as gold. In some cultures, yellow is a special color, connotating wealth, power, or fortune.</p>
    <h1>Orange:</h1>
    <p>Orange is a very energetic color. It invokes physical activity and determination for me. It's a solid color!</p>
    <h1>Red:</h1>
    <p>Red is also a very energetic color. While it may be associated with aggression, I think energy and drive would be more accurate! The boldness of red is what makes it my favorite color.</p>
